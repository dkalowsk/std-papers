# Preamble

We propose the following text be adopted as the basis for a new standing
document.  If accepted, we encourage all committee members to discuss it and
reference it regularly. We believe that clarifying the line between "what will
work for the moment" and "what may not work in the face of changes to the
standard" will improve the quality of C++ code and reduce the difficulty in
updating to new language versions.

# Standard Library Compatibility

For a sufficiently clever user, effectively any change we make to the standard
library will be a breaking change. In a few instances, the standard itself is
clear about what users are not allowed to do ("do not take the address of member
functions of standard types", "do not add new names into namespace std") - those
restrictions are not widely understood, are incomplete, and leave completely
unclear **why** those rules are in place. In keeping with general discussions of
compatibility, and as mentioned in P0684, we should be clear to users about what
does and does not constitute supported use of the C++ standard library.  What
rights does the committee reserve in order to make changes to the standard
library in the future? 

Note in particular that users of the standard are not special in this: abuse of
these rules is generally bad usage for most libraries.

## Rights the Standard Library Reserves for Itself

Primarily, the standard reserves the right to:

*   Add new names to namespace `std`
*   Add new member functions to types in namespace `std`
*   Add new overloads to existing functions
*   Add new default parameters to functions and templates
*   Change return-types of functions in compatible ways (void to anything,
    numeric types in a widening fashion, etc)
*   Make changes to existing interfaces in a fashion that will be backward
    compatible, if those interfaces are solely used to instantiate types and
    invoke functions. Implementation details (the primary name of a type, the
    implementation details for a function callable) may not be depended upon.
    *   For example, we may change implementation details for standard function
        templates so that those become callable function objects. If user code
        only invokes that callable, the behavior is unchanged.
